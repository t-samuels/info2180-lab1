            <h2>Tiana Samuels</h2>
            <p>I was born and raised in Kingston, Jamaica and I turned 22 years old last month. I am currently studying Information Technology at the University of the West Indies on the Mona Campus. I am interested in studying Web Development because I think it would be helpful to have some kind of knowledge on it if I am pursuing a job in the field of Information Technology.</p>
